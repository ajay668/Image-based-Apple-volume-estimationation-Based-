# Image-based-Apple-volume-estimationation-Based-
In this project we have predicted the volume of the axially symmetric fruit such as Apple based on Image(form single angle). 
A simple image processing techniques are used to estimate the volume of apple. 
Since we are estimating the volume using image. Pixel to centimeter conversion is necessary.
